# Deep-Q-Learning
The following project is an implementation of a **Deep Q Learning** algorithm, which was developped as an assignment at Imperial College London. The environment in the random_environment.py file was provided to us by the college.


## Detailed Description of the Algorithm



## Getting started
1. Clone the project and create a virtual environment
2. Install the required packages in the virtual environment
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the algorithm with the train_and_test.py function
